About
-----

Low count statistics is not that hard. It's just not Gaussian.

This package can answer the following questions:

* Given k detected objects, what are the uncertainties on the true number of objects? (`poissonregime.uncertainties_rate`)
* Given k "hits" out of a sample of n tries, what is the fraction and its uncertainty? (`poissonregime.uncertainties_fraction`)
* What is the significance of k detections, given that I expect B background events? (`poissonregime.significance`)

  * what if I measure the background events from counts in a "off" region?
  * what if I have additional systematic uncertainty?

* What is the probability distribution on the event rate, given a measured background rate? (`poissonregime.posterior`)

You can help by testing poissonregime and reporting issues. Code contributions are welcome.
